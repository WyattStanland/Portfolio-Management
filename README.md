This project attempted to calculate a long-term portfolio of assets based on the efficient frontier concept in Modern Portfolio Theory. The method used is 
mean-variance analysis as described in the paper cited above. A set of stocks were selected for analysis based on qualitative metrics like cap size, historical 
leadership stability, and industry trends.
